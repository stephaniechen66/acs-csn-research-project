We are students of [Carnegie Mellon University](cmu.edu) under the direction of Professor [Robert Kraut](http://kraut.hciresearch.org/). We're all majoring in [Human Computer Interaction](hcii.cmu.edu), which is the study of making computer systems that human beings can actually use. However, we also have other interests and majors outside the HCII.


###Taylor Poulos

Taylor is a triple major in Information Systems, Human Computer Interaction, and Creative Writing. He sees himself as the kind of designer that codes, and believes in making products that work in practice, not just in theory. Outside of class he is director of [ScottyLabs](scottylabs.org), a student organization that provides educational opportunities for students, beyond what's normally taught in the classroom.
