          <p>We are students of <a href="cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> under the direction of Professor <a href="http://kraut.hciresearch.org/">Robert Kraut</a>. We&#39;re all majoring in <a href="hcii.cmu.edu">Human Computer Interaction</a>, which is the study of making computer systems that human beings can actually use. However, we also have other interests and majors outside the HCII.</p>

<h3>Taylor Poulos</h3>

<p>Taylor is a triple major in Information Systems, Human Computer Interaction, and Creative Writing. He sees himself as the kind of designer that codes, and believes in making products that work in practice, not just in theory. Outside of class he is director of <a href="scottylabs.org">ScottyLabs</a>, a student organization that provides educational opportunities for students, beyond what&#39;s normally taught in the classroom.</p>

<h3>Yueying Tang</h3>

<p>Yueying is currently a visiting intern in Carnegie Mellon University HCII Social Computing Lab, who is a senior in Department of Computer Science, Renmin University of China. She believes good design makes a real difference and she loves designing products that enrich people&#39;s life. She knows that there is still an amazing amount to learn, but she prefer learning by doing. Please check out her <a href="http://yueyingtang.me/">portfolio</a> to know more about her project experiences, skill sets and personal interests.</p>
